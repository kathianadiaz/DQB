Deep Q-learning Box (DQB)

DQB’s main focus lies in the encapsulation of complex or convoluted code required to set up a working Q-learning agent meanwhile providing a set of environments to train and test. 

Creation of a simplified DQB agent:

With premade parameters for each agent, one would be able to change its internal properties. 
Design the structure of the neural network used to compute the Q-value.
One would alter the agent’s parameters to see the effect it had on its ability to perform within an environment.

Training and testing:

Simple environments held within the Gym library will provide a way to test and train a model.
Statistics of the model that show its current effectiveness within the specific environment. 
Training the model using a discrete GPU.

Libraries:
Keras 
Gym
Tensorflow
PLY
